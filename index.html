    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question"> 1) Is it safe to use Virtual Mobile Number?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, using a virtual mobile number is generally safe, but it depends on the provider and purpose. Reputable services offer encryption and privacy protection, making them secure for temporary use, such as OTP verification or online registrations. However, some free or less-known providers might sell data or lack security measures, leading to privacy risks. To ensure safety, always choose a trusted service, avoid sharing sensitive information, and check the provider’s privacy policies before using their virtual number.</p>

        <button class="faq-question"> 2) Do I need to keep the app running in background to receive calls? </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No, you don’t need to keep the app running in the background to receive calls if it uses push notifications. Most modern calling apps, like WhatsApp and Messenger, rely on push notifications to wake up the app when a call comes in. This means the app doesn’t have to be actively running, saving battery and system resources. However, if the app doesn’t use push notifications, it may require running in the background to receive calls.</p>

        <button class="faq-question"> 3) Can I use this number for 2 step authentications via sms?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, you can use this number for two-step authentication via SMS if the service provider supports it. Most platforms, like Google, Facebook, and banking apps, allow verification codes to be sent via SMS for added security. However, if your number is linked to an internet-based service or VoIP, some platforms may not accept it for authentication. Always check with the specific service to ensure compatibility.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question"> 4) How much time does it takes for sms to be delivered to my email?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The time it takes for an SMS to be delivered to your email depends on various factors, including the service provider, network traffic, and any potential delays in email processing. Typically, SMS-to-email forwarding happens within a few seconds to a couple of minutes. However, in cases of high network congestion or technical issues, it might take longer. If delays persist, checking spam folders or contacting your service provider can help resolve the issue.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">5) Is there an option to change my email for receiving voicemails?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, most voicemail services allow you to change the email where you receive voicemails. You can usually update your email through your service provider’s website, mobile app, or by contacting customer support. Some systems also offer settings within their voicemail menu to modify email preferences. If you’re unsure, check your provider’s help section or reach out for assistance.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">6) What is the cancellation policy?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The cancellation policy varies depending on the service provider and subscription type. Generally, you can cancel anytime through the provider’s website, app, or customer support. Some services offer refunds if canceled within a specific period, while others may have a no-refund policy. It’s best to review the terms and conditions or contact support for details.</p>

    <div class="network-container">
     <div>We work with Hutchison 3 which is one of the largest mobile networks in the UK and a network that is recognised globally by all major telecom operators. This means guaranteed reachability and total peace of mind that you can be reached by anyone around the world by call or SMS 24/7. Not only is it free for you to receive calls and SMS messages on our numbers, but anyone calling or texting you from the UK on your Virtual Mobile number can do so for free using their inclusive bundled
        minutes and texts.</div>
     <div>This is the major differentiating factor that separates us from our competitors. Most other virtual mobile number providers use numbers belonging to smaller, little heard of UK Mobile Networks. This could mean restricted accessibility for receiving calls and texts, especially one-time passcodes. It also means that people trying to call or text you could end up with expensive phone bills as large telecoms operators often charge a surcharge for calls made to UK virtual mobile numbers belonging to smaller unheard-of networks! Most of our competitors will hide this fact and won't tell you which network their numbers are on. We are open about the fact that our numbers are on the 3 networks!</div>
